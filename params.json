{"name":"Crossdata","tagline":"Easy access to big things","body":"# About #\r\n\r\nCrossdata (aka Meta) is a distributed framework that unifies the interaction with batch and streaming sources supporting multiple datastore technologies thanks to its generic architecture and a custom SQL-like language with support for streaming queries. Supporting multiple architectures imposes two main challenges: how to normalize the access to the datastores, and how to cope with datastore limitations. To access multiple technologies Crossdata defines a common unifying interface containing the set of operations that a datastore may support. New connectors can be easily added to increase its connectivity capabilities. Two types of connectors are defined: native and spark-based. Native connectors are faster for simple operations, while Spark-based connectors offer a larger set of functionality. The Crossdata planner decides which connector will be used for any request based its characteristics. We offer a shell, Java/REST APIs, and ODBC for BI.\r\n\r\n## Full documentation ##\r\n\r\nSee the Wiki for full documentation, examples, operational details and other information.\r\n\r\nSee the [Javadoc] () and [Language reference] () for the internal details.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites ##\r\n\r\nIn order to execute Crossdata, the following elements are required:\r\n\r\n1. A working installation of Cassandra. The Stratio-cassandra fork is required to support LUCENE indexes.\r\n2. A working installation of Stratio Deep. Otherwise, advanced capabilities such as SELECT with INNER JOIN will not be available.\r\n\r\n## Compiling Crossdata ##\r\n\r\nCompiling Crossdata involves generating a set of files (.tokens, Lexers, and Parsers) from the different grammar files. To automatically build Stratio Crossdata execute the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   > mvn clean compile install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running the crossdata-server##\r\n\r\n```\r\n   > mvn exec:java -DskipTests -pl meta-server -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.stratio.meta.server.MetaApplication\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running the crosdata-shell ##\r\n\r\nThe crossdata-shell allows users to launch interactive queries against a set of Crossdata servers. \r\nWorks both in Unix and Windows.\r\nThe shell features:\r\n\r\n - History support (arrow navigation)\r\n - History search (ctrl-r)\r\n - Token completion (tab)\r\n - Help command\r\n\r\n```\r\n   > mvn exec:java -pl meta-sh -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.stratio.meta.sh.Metash\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe shell also supports asynchronous query execution by means of the --async parameter. This execution mode is required for streaming queries.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   > mvn exec:java -pl meta-sh -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.stratio.meta.sh.Metash\" -Dexec.args=\"--async\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can execute an script upon launching the shell. The script will be executed first, and the prompt will be shown afterwards.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   > mvn exec:java -pl meta-sh -Dexec.mainClass=\"com.stratio.meta.sh.Metash\" -Dexec.args=\"--script /path/script.metaql\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Packaging ##\r\n\r\n```\r\n   > mvn package\r\n```\r\nSee [this link](https://github.com/Stratio/stratio-meta/edit/release/0.0.4/meta-dist/src/main/include/README.md) to know start/stop the server and the shell from the dist packages\r\n\r\n\r\n## Useful commands ##\r\n\r\nOnce the shell is running, you can exit the program introducing the word **exit** or **quit** in the query prompt. A command help system is available by introducing the command **help**. A help entry is available per command, to check specify help topics use **help command**.\r\n\r\n## More about the project ##\r\n\r\nYou can find more information about this project (tutorials, examples, etc...) in http://wordpress.dev.strat.io/\r\n\r\n# License #\r\n\r\nStratio Crossdata is licensed as [Apache2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)\r\n\r\nLicensed to STRATIO (C) under one or more contributor license agreements.  \r\nSee the NOTICE file distributed with this work for additional information \r\nregarding copyright ownership.
