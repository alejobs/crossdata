# Connector Operations #

This document will provided a detailed description of the different operations that can be supported by a Crossdata 
connector. The document is organized as follows:

1. [Definition of Connector Operation](#definition-of-connector-operation)
2. [Types of Operations](#types-of-operations)
  1. [Metadata](#project)
  2. [Storage](#filter)
  3. [Query](#select)
3. [More information](#more-information)

Definition of Connector Operation
=================================

A connector operation defines a capability a connector provides. All connector operations must be declared in their 
associated manifest. As an example, consider the following *InMemoryConnector.xml* manifest 

```xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- This file contains the manifest for the connector. -->
<Connector>
    <!-- Name of the connector as it will be identified in Crossdata -->
    <ConnectorName>InMemoryConnector</ConnectorName>
    <!-- Define the list of datastore this connector is able to access. -->
    <DataStores>
        <DataStoreName>InMemoryDatastore</DataStoreName>
    </DataStores>
    <!-- Connector version -->
    <Version>0.0.1</Version>

    <!-- Define the set of required operations the user will be asked to input
    when attaching the connector -->

    <!--OptionalProperties>
        <Property>
            <PropertyName>TableRowLimit</PropertyName>
            <Description>Limit of rows allowed per table</Description>
        </Property>
    </OptionalProperties-->

    <!-- Define the list of operations supported by the connector.
    Check crossdata/doc/ConnectorOperations.md for more information. -->
    <SupportedOperations>
        <operation>CREATE_CATALOG</operation>
        <operation>DROP_CATALOG</operation>
        <operation>CREATE_TABLE</operation>
        <operation>DROP_TABLE</operation>
        <operation>TRUNCATE_TABLE</operation>
        <operation>INSERT</operation>
        <operation>PROJECT</operation>
        <operation>SELECT_OPERATOR</operation>
        <operation>SELECT_LIMIT</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_PK_EQ</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_PK_GT</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_PK_LT</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_PK_GET</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_PK_LET</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_NON_INDEXED_EQ</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_NON_INDEXED_GT</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_NON_INDEXED_LT</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_NON_INDEXED_GET</operation>
        <operation>FILTER_NON_INDEXED_LET</operation>
    </SupportedOperations>
</Connector>
```

Each operation is associated with the methods found in *IMetadataEngine*, *IStorageEngine*, 
and *IQueryEngine*. The following section provides a detailed description of each operation organized by the type of 
operation.

Types of Operations
===================

The connector operations are organized attending to the type of operation to be performed: Metadata, Storage, 
and Query. In order to simplify the definition of the different connector, two concepts are taken into account: 
*column_type*, and *relationship*.

The column type is identified by Crossdata during the query analysis with the following types:

| column_type | Description |
|--------|------------|
| PK | The column is part of the primary key. |
| INDEXED | The column is indexed. |
| NON_INDEXED | The column is not indexed. |
| FUNCTION | A includes is associated with the column. |

With respect to the relationship, Crossdata supports:

| relationship | Description |
|--------|------------|
| EQ | Equals. |
| GT | Greater than. |
| LT | Less than. |
| GET | Greater or equal than. |
| LET | Less or equal than. |
| ASSIGN | A value is to be assigned to a column. |
| MATCH | Compare a column with a Lucene-like expression. |

Metadata
--------

Metadata operations are those associated with the *IMetadataEngine* interface.

* **CREATE_CATALOG**: Create new catalogs.
* **DROP_CATALOG**: Delete existing catalogs.
* **CREATE_TABLE**: Create a new table.
* **ALTER_TABLE**: Alter the definition of an existing table.
* **DROP_TABLE**: Drop an existing table.
* **CREATE_INDEX**: Create a new index.
* **DROP_INDEX**: Drop an existing index.

Storage
-------

* **INSERT**: Insert a new row in the datastore. By default inserts are considered upsert operations.
* **INSERT_IF_NOT_EXISTS**: Insert a new row in the datastore if that row does not exist without the upsert behaviour.
* **DELETE_<column_type>_<relationship>**: Delete rows for the given type of columns and relations.
* **UPDATE_<column_type>_<relationship>**: Update rows for the give type of columns and relations.
* **TRUNCATE_TABLE**: Truncate the contents of an existing table.


Query
-----

* **ASYNC_QUERY**: Support for asynchronous query execution.
* **PROJECT**: Retrieve a set of columns from a specific table.
* **SELECT_OPERATOR**: Select a set of output columns for a query with alias.
* **SELECT_WINDOW**: Supports WINDOW clauses for streaming-like queries.
* **SELECT_LIMIT**: Limit the number of output rows.
* **SELECT_INNER_JOIN**: Support for INNER JOIN operations.
* **SELECT_INNER_JOIN_PARTIALS_RESULTS**: Support for INNER JOIN with one source already defined.
* **SELECT_ORDER_BY**: Support for ORDER BY clauses.
* **SELECT_GROUP_BY**: Support for GROUP BY clauses.
* **FILTER_<column_type>_<relationship>**: Filter a column by a particular relationship.
